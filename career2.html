                                We are one of the leading providers of home care services in the Bay Area. Care Indeed
                                was founded in 2010 by two nurses with extensive caregiving experience. They had a dream
                                to transform the way home care was delivered, by focusing on the employees. Care Indeed
                                is the first caregiver staffing agency to use innovative technology and programs to
                                train its team. We have four offices and over 700 employees; for the past three years,
                                we have ranked in the Top 50 Best Companies to Work For in caregiving jobs in San
                                Francisco.

                                important component to caring for each client whom we serve.
